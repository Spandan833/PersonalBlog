              Hello! I'm Spandan, an RF Test engineer with a passion for
              building websites. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I
              share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge about RF engineering
              and web development.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              With several years of experience in the field of RF testing, I've
              worked on a variety of projects ranging from mobile devices to
              satellite communications. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the
              world of web development, constantly learning new technologies and
              frameworks.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              This blog is a platform for me to share insights from both these
              worlds. You'll find articles about RF engineering concepts,
              testing methodologies, as well as web development tutorials and my
              experiences with different programming languages and frameworks.
