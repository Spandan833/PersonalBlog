## Generative AI

Unless you have been living under a rock over the past couple of years, you must have heard of Generative AI products being launched by major tech companies. The most prominent of these models are LLM or Large Language Models which can respond to user "prompts". Major tech giants like Google and Meta have already release their LLM products namely Gemini and Llama. Meta is leading the field in open source models, which means you can download the model weights and run it on your own system locally (provided you have the hardware required to run it). But the most well known LLM in the market today is undoubtedly OpenAI's **ChatGPT**, which has already entered the vocabulary of non-tech personnel.

## Utilizing Generative AI as a Software Engineer

But as a developer, I have been really impressed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the most advanced model from Anthropic yet. I have been using it for building out Frontends in both vanilla js and creating React components. From my observation, this works best if you are using a styling library like Tailwind. Ocassionally, it can get a few edeges and corners off but I have had success by pointing out the error and it was able to fix the problem.

While its ability to follow exact to the tee instructions, it does a good job of making my website look presentable. I generally upload a picture of a website similar to what I want and ask the model to give me the code for that utilising tailwind. I also try to provide as much context to the model as possible, the tech stack you are using, what libraries you want or don't want the model to use - be as precise as possible.

## Open source LLM

So far I've mentioned about proprietary LLMs, but Meta and Google have release open source LLMs as well. Llama 3 is Meta's flagship model and also open source. You can even access it through <a href="meta.ai">meta.ai</a>. The model has impressive capability in text generation and performs reasonably on simpler coding tasks. However its not quite good at complex tasks like debugging and creative writing.

Another newcomer making waves in the Open Source models is Mixtral, a French startup which has been releasing models of various degrees of capability including 7B and 22B variants. These model have varying degree of capabilities in wide range of tasks.
